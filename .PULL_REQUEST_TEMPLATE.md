Author checklist
================

This PR template is meant to be helpful, not painful.

Not all checkboxes or sections need filled out.
But please try to make life easier on your teammates and reviewers.

Branching

- [ ] I am using feature/bugfix prefixes for my branch names
- [ ] I have rebased to the `develop` branch, and I am merging into `develop`

Maintainability

- [ ] I have taken a pass at the PR code before assigning to others
- [ ] I have sufficient tests that prove my fix or feature works
- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)

Communication

- [ ] I have filled out the PR template sufficiently with details
- [ ] I have linked to all relevant issues and notified the right people
- [ ] I have assigned at least one or two reviewers
- [ ] I have discussed any larger changes in a Slack thread or channel with others

Reviewer checklist
==================

As a reviewer, it is suggested that anything is fair game to comment, but style or
implementation approach should be respected and at the discretion of the submitter,
unless it substantially affects the architecture of the codebase.

- [ ] I have made it clear what I think must change, versus friendly suggestions
- [ ] I have suggested additional automated tests, if warranted
- [ ] I have suggested extra documentation, if warranted
- [ ] I have tested the code, if it is a riskier change
